Task 1:
Task one is a simple program where a user can see different variables assigned to different data types. In this program the programmer has also included the different basic operations for separate data types. This program also includes a dictionary which shows the data types of User entered values.
	How it works- Once the code is running it asks the user to input different numbers for the data types and 	performs operations

Task 2: 
Task 2 is also a simple program which identifies if a user entered number is positive negative or zero. This program keeps running until user inputs "exit". With the use of while loop when an user inputs "exit" the code stops but if the user enters a number then the code keeps on going and does its intended task. With the use of conditional programs the code compares user entered number with the programmer given condition and shows the output.

Task 3:
Task 3 is also a Simple Calculator. It asks user what arithmetic operation they want to perform and does so according to user input. The programmer has made different functions for different arithmetic operations and when the user inputs their choice the function is called according to their choice. Once the function is called it does the user intended operation and prints the output

Task 4:
Task 4 is a Simple to do list. In this program there are 3 different files. Utils.py is the utility file. Todo_operations.py is the logical part of the program. It collects user given input and does whatever the user has asked for. It contains functions for adding, viewing and deleting the tasks. Main.py handles user interaction. It asks user what they want to do. Send the user input to todo_operation.py and gets value from it and prints it.
